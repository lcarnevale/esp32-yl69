# ESP32 Soil Moisture Sensor YL-69 or HL-69 Driver

This project containes the ESP-IDF driver both for the YL-69 and HL-69 soil moisture sensor. This sensor output is the voltage that changes accordingly to the water content in the soil. Specifically, when the soil is:
- **wet** the output voltage decreases
- **dry** the output voltage increases
